# homeserver setup

this is the readme describing the whole setup of my homeserver

## server itself

the server itself is a `raspberry pi 4 model b` with 8G ram. connected to it is a 500G external ssd, from which the system also boots. it is connected via usb-3.

it is available in my home network under `homeserver.local`. i can just ssh into it on that url, given that i am on the system with the registered ssh key.

## components
